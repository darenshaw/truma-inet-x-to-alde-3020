# The BLE address is a resolvable private address that still pins the panel to
# a location, and muid/uuid are the persisted app identity the panel bonds
# against. The bus carries addresses too, but not under names like these --
# see ``_ADDRESS_SHAPED`` below, which is what covers them.
# discovery_keys is here because redaction works on key names and that
# subtree hides the address inside a value: Home Assistant serialises the key
# as ``"repr": "DiscoveryKey(domain='bluetooth', key='76:32:EF:78:FD:1A',
# version=1)"``, which no address-named key matches. Every download written
# before this line carried the panel's address in it, the three attached to
# issue #22 included. The value pass below would now catch it as well; the key
# stays because the whole subtree is of no use to a reader anyway.

REDACTED = "**REDACTED**"

# An address in every spelling a download has been seen carrying, and the
# panel's advertised name, whose last three bytes are its identity address.
#
# Key names cannot find these, which is why ``TO_REDACT`` is not the whole
# answer. On the bus a key name is the panel's own vocabulary rather than ours,
# and the addresses that are on it sit in *values* of keys that say nothing:
# the LevelControl gas-bottle sensors publish their own MAC as an ordinary
# string parameter, described as ``{"type": 4, "avail": 1}`` like any other,
# and measured on the vehicle of #35 as
#
#     "0x0603": {"params": {"BluetoothDevice.BleAddress": "90:7B:C6:..",
#                           "BluetoothDevice.BleAddressType": 0, ...
#
# with ``BleAddressType: 0`` saying they are public, so permanent rather than
# rotating. One of the two shared a prefix with that panel's identity address.
# Redacting only ``BleAddress`` by name would cover those two and nothing a
# device publishes next under another name.
#
# Values only, never keys: two addresses used as keys in one dict would redact
# to one key and silently drop an entry. ``tools/import_dump.py`` hunts the
# same patterns on the way into ``dumps/`` and refuses a file where one
# survives, which is what catches a download taken before this line existed.

    The download is the evidence somebody pastes into an issue, so it is
    rendered the way the bus is read and quoted: every address in hex, and
    every value under the device that published it. json.dumps renders an int
    key as bare decimal -- 1539, not 0x0603 -- which then has to be converted
    by hand before it lines up with anything else in the report.

    Two passes of redaction, because they find different things. Key names
    cover the config entry, where the keys are Home Assistant's own and known.
    The address hunt covers everything, including the bus, where the keys are
    the panel's vocabulary and an address arrives as the value of one that says
    nothing about itself (#35).
