"""Offline checks that a diagnostics download carries no Bluetooth address.

The download is what people paste into issues and attach to threads, so every
address in one is published for good. Two rounds of this have now been paid
for: the config entry's own address, which redaction by key name missed inside
a ``DiscoveryKey`` repr until b15, and then #35 -- the gas-bottle sensors
publish *their* addresses as ordinary bus parameters, which travel a path
nothing redacted at all.

    "0x0603": {"params": {"BluetoothDevice.BleAddress": "90:7B:C6:..",
                          "BluetoothDevice.BleAddressType": 0, ...

``BleAddressType: 0`` says those are public addresses: permanent identifiers
rather than rotating ones, and one of the two shared a prefix with that
panel's identity address.

Why this file rather than the two next door: ``test_diagnostics_shapes.py``
runs ``bus.py`` with no Home Assistant at all and cannot see the writer, and
``test_bus_dump_tool.py``, which does drive the real writer, needs cbor2 for
the protocol stack behind it. Redaction needs neither. It is the one thing in
a download that has to hold whether or not somebody installed a library, so it
is checked where nothing can be skipped.

What it pins:

1. an address a *device* published is gone, wherever in the bus it sits,
2. every spelling is caught, including the panel's advertised name, and
   including values no key name could have found,
3. what a reader actually needs -- serials, labels, readings, the address
   *type* -- survives the pass,
4. and the redacted download still reads back into a bus.

Run: ``python3 tests/test_diagnostics_redaction.py``
